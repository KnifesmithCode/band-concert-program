# Hello there!

I'm not sure how you found this, but hello! The main reason I'm adding a README is so that GitHub pages hopefully recognizes that I have an index.html.
If you're curious as to what this is, my band director asked me to throw together a quick website for our Christmas concert in leiu of paper programs due to COVID-19 restrictions. The site looks a little strange on PC, and is admittedly hacked together, but looks alright on a phone for a night's work without any templates or frameworks (the internet speed in the school is notoriously slow).
